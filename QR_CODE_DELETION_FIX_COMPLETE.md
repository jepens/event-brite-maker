# QR Code Deletion Fix - Complete

## Problem Description

The application had a delete registration feature that would delete user registration data and associated tickets, but it was not properly cleaning up QR code images stored in Supabase storage. The QR codes were being left behind in the `event-logos` bucket under the `qr-codes` folder, causing storage bloat and orphaned files.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `deleteQRCodeFiles` function in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`. The function was trying to construct QR code filenames using `short_code` or `ticket.id`, but the actual filename pattern used when generating QR codes is:

```
qr-${registration_id}-${Date.now()}.png
```

For example: `qr-b26a4ac4-ff89-4a17-987e-67850cdeaf44-1754413043808.png`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed QR Code Filename Extraction

Updated the `deleteQRCodeFiles` function to:
- Fetch tickets with `qr_image_url` instead of `short_code`
- Extract the actual filename from the `qr_image_url` stored in the database
- Use the correct file path for deletion

**Before:**
```typescript
const { data: tickets, error: ticketsError } = await supabase
  .from('tickets')
  .select('id, short_code')
  .eq('registration_id', registrationId);

// Try to delete QR code file using short_code if available, otherwise use ticket ID
const fileName = ticket.short_code ? `qr-${ticket.short_code}` : `qr-${ticket.id}`;
const filePath = `qr-codes/${fileName}.png`;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { data: tickets, error: ticketsError } = await supabase
  .from('tickets')
  .select('id, qr_image_url')
  .eq('registration_id', registrationId);

// Extract filename from qr_image_url
const urlParts = ticket.qr_image_url.split('/');
const fileName = urlParts[urlParts.length - 1];
const filePath = `qr-codes/${fileName}`;
```

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

Updated the delete confirmation dialog in `src/components/admin/registrations/DeleteDialog.tsx` to explicitly mention that QR code images will be deleted:

```typescript
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
  <li>Delete the registration record</li>
  <li>Delete all associated tickets</li>
  <li>Remove QR code images from storage</li>
  <li>Remove all related data permanently</li>
</ul>
```

### 3. Comprehensive Testing

Testing telah selesai dan berhasil memverifikasi fungsi:

- ✅ Individual QR code file deletion berfungsi dengan baik
- ✅ Complete registration deletion process berfungsi dengan baik
- ✅ QR code files berhasil dihapus dari Supabase storage
- ✅ Database cleanup berjalan dengan konsisten

## Files Modified

1. **`src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`**
   - Fixed `deleteQRCodeFiles` function to properly extract filenames from URLs
   - Updated database query to fetch `qr_image_url` instead of `short_code`

2. **`src/components/admin/registrations/DeleteDialog.tsx`**
   - Added mention of QR code image deletion in the confirmation dialog

3. **Testing Scripts** (Removed after successful testing)
   - Test scripts telah dihapus setelah verifikasi berhasil

## How It Works

1. **Registration Deletion Process:**
   - User clicks delete on a registration
   - System fetches all tickets associated with the registration
   - For each ticket, extracts the QR code filename from the `qr_image_url`
   - Deletes the QR code file from Supabase storage (`event-logos/qr-codes/`)
   - Deletes all associated tickets from the database
   - Finally deletes the registration record

2. **Error Handling:**
   - If QR code deletion fails, the process continues with other files
   - If ticket deletion fails, the entire process is rolled back
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

3. **Storage Cleanup:**
   - Files are removed from the `event-logos` bucket under the `qr-codes` folder
   - Uses the exact filename stored in the database
   - Handles multiple QR codes per registration

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create a registration with QR codes
2. Navigate to admin dashboard
3. Delete the registration
4. Verify QR code files are removed from Supabase storage

### Testing Status
Testing telah selesai dan berhasil:
- ✅ Individual QR deletion berfungsi dengan baik
- ✅ Complete registration deletion berfungsi dengan baik
- ✅ QR code files berhasil dihapus dari storage
- ✅ Database cleanup konsisten

## Benefits

1. **Storage Optimization:** Prevents accumulation of orphaned QR code files
2. **Cost Reduction:** Reduces Supabase storage costs
3. **Data Integrity:** Ensures complete cleanup when registrations are deleted
4. **User Experience:** Clear indication of what will be deleted
5. **Maintainability:** Proper error handling and logging

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated admin users can delete registrations
- QR code deletion is tied to registration deletion (no standalone QR deletion)
- Proper error handling prevents partial deletions
- All operations are logged for audit purposes

## Future Improvements

1. **Batch Operations:** Consider implementing batch QR code cleanup for multiple registrations
2. **Storage Monitoring:** Add storage usage monitoring and cleanup alerts
3. **Recovery Options:** Consider soft delete with recovery options for critical data
4. **Performance:** Optimize for large-scale deletions if needed

## Conclusion

The QR code deletion fix ensures that when registrations are deleted, all associated QR code images are properly removed from Supabase storage. This prevents storage bloat and maintains data consistency across the application.

The solution is robust, well-tested, and provides clear feedback to users about what will be deleted during the registration removal process.
