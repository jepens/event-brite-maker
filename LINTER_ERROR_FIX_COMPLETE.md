# Linter Error Fix Complete

## Summary
Successfully fixed all linter errors in `src/lib/download-service.ts` while maintaining the functionality for including custom fields in download reports.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. TypeScript `any` Type Errors
**Problem**: Multiple instances of `any[]` type usage for custom fields
**Solution**: Created a proper `CustomField` interface and replaced all `any[]` with `CustomField[]`

```typescript
// Added proper type definition
interface CustomField {
  name: string;
  label: string;
  type: string;
  required?: boolean;
  options?: string[];
}

// Updated interfaces
export interface RegistrationData {
  // ... other fields
  event_custom_fields?: CustomField[];
}

export interface CheckinReportData {
  // ... other fields
  event_custom_fields?: CustomField[];
}
```

### 2. Type Casting Issues
**Problem**: Type casting with `any[]` in event object access
**Solution**: Updated type casting to use `CustomField[]`

```typescript
// Before
(registration.events as { custom_fields?: any[] })?.custom_fields || []

// After
(registration.events as { custom_fields?: CustomField[] })?.custom_fields || []
```

### 3. `prefer-const` Errors
**Problem**: Variables declared with `let` that were never reassigned
**Solution**: Changed `let` to `const` for variables that are never reassigned

```typescript
// Before
let dataKey = headerMapping[header];

// After
const dataKey = headerMapping[header];
```

### 4. Type Conversion Issues
**Problem**: `unknown` type not assignable to `string` type
**Solution**: Added explicit `String()` conversion for unknown values

```typescript
// Before
value = (row as Record<string, unknown>)[dataKey] || '';

// After
value = String((row as Record<string, unknown>)[dataKey] || '');
```

### 5. Interface Index Signature
**Problem**: `PDFOptions` interface not compatible with `Record<string, unknown>`
**Solution**: Added index signature to `PDFOptions` interface

```typescript
// Before
export interface PDFOptions {
  eventId?: string;
  title?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  includeSummary?: boolean;
}

// After
export interface PDFOptions {
  eventId?: string;
  title?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  includeSummary?: boolean;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/download-service.ts`

## Verification
- ✅ Linter passes with 0 errors (only warnings remain)
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved for custom fields in download reports

## Remaining Warnings
The remaining warnings are related to:
- React Hook dependencies (non-critical)
- Fast refresh component exports (non-critical)

These warnings do not affect the functionality and are common in React applications.

## Impact
- All download functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF) continues to work correctly
- Custom fields are properly included in all report formats
- Type safety is improved throughout the download service
- Code is now more maintainable and follows TypeScript best practices
