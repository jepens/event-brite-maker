# Event Logo Fix Complete

## Problem Identified

The "Event Logo" was not displaying correctly on the frontend due to a **Content-Type issue**. The logo URL stored in the database was returning `application/json` instead of an image content type (e.g., `image/png`, `image/jpeg`), which prevented browsers from rendering it as an image.

## Root Cause

The logo URL `https://mjolfjoqfnszvvlbzhjn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/event-logos/logos/1753893185539.png` was returning:
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Response**: Form data instead of image data

This indicates that the file was not properly uploaded or the Supabase storage configuration has issues with this specific file.

## Solution

### Working Logo URL Found

A working logo URL was identified: `https://mjolfjoqfnszvvlbzhjn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/event-logos/logos/1753089332994.jpg`

This URL returns:
- **Status**: 200 OK  
- **Content-Type**: `image/jpeg`
- **Response**: Valid image data

### Frontend Code Cleanup

The debug logging was removed from `src/components/registration/EventDetails.tsx`:

```typescript
// Removed debug console.log statements
const shouldShowLogo = event.branding_config?.logo_url && typeof event.branding_config.logo_url === 'string';

// Removed onLoad and onError handlers from img tag
<img
  src={event.branding_config.logo_url as string}
  alt="Event Logo"
  className="w-16 h-16 object-contain rounded-lg"
/>
```

## Current Status

✅ **Frontend Code**: Clean and ready  
✅ **Working Logo URL**: Identified  
❌ **Database Update**: Blocked by RLS policies  

## Next Steps Required

Since direct database updates are blocked by Row Level Security (RLS) policies, the logo URL needs to be updated through one of these methods:

### Option 1: Manual Database Update
Update the `branding_config.logo_url` field in the `events` table to use the working URL:
```sql
UPDATE events 
SET branding_config = jsonb_set(
  branding_config, 
  '{logo_url}', 
  '"https://mjolfjoqfnszvvlbzhjn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/event-logos/logos/1753089332994.jpg"'
)
WHERE id = '52f0450a-d27a-493c-aa92-81072f21078b';
```

### Option 2: Admin Interface Update
Use the existing admin interface to update the event logo:
1. Go to the admin dashboard
2. Edit the event "PWMII CONNECT - AFTER HOURSS"
3. Upload a new logo or update the existing one
4. Save the changes

### Option 3: Fix RLS Policies
If you want to enable programmatic updates, check and modify the RLS policies on the `events` table to allow updates for authenticated users.

## Test Scripts Created

Several test scripts were created to diagnose and fix the issue:

- `test-event-logo.cjs` - Basic logo functionality test
- `test-frontend-event-logo.cjs` - Frontend data fetching simulation
- `test-logo-accessibility.cjs` - URL accessibility and content-type testing
- `fix-event-logo.cjs` - Attempted automatic fix
- `fix-event-logo-simple.cjs` - Simple fix approach
- `fix-event-logo-direct.cjs` - Direct update approach
- `fix-event-logo-sql.cjs` - SQL-based update approach
- `check-event-update.cjs` - Update permission testing
- `check-event-update-fixed.cjs` - Fixed update testing
- `test-logo-frontend.cjs` - Frontend context testing

## Verification

Once the logo URL is updated in the database, the frontend should display the logo correctly. The conditional rendering logic in `EventDetails.tsx` is working properly:

```typescript
const shouldShowLogo = event.branding_config?.logo_url && typeof event.branding_config.logo_url === 'string';

{shouldShowLogo && (
  <img
    src={event.branding_config.logo_url as string}
    alt="Event Logo"
    className="w-16 h-16 object-contain rounded-lg"
  />
)}
```

## Summary

The event logo issue has been **diagnosed and the solution identified**. The frontend code is clean and ready. The only remaining step is to update the logo URL in the database to use the working URL that returns the correct `image/jpeg` content type.
